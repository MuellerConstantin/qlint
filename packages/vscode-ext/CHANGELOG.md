## [Unreleased]

### Added

- VS Code extension that injects `@qlinter/core` into the editor for Qlik load
  scripts, contributing a `qlik` language for `.qvs` files (with a file icon)
  and activating on first open.
- Inline lint feedback published to the Problems panel and rendered against the
  offending ranges, refreshed live as the document changes and cleared when it
  closes.
- Core autofixes surfaced as Quick Fix code actions on each fixable diagnostic.
- Whole-document formatting via a document formatting provider, so "Format
  Document" and `editor.formatOnSave` reformat Qlik scripts through Core's
  `format()`.
- A `source.fixAll` code action that applies every autofix in one pass, wired for
  the "Fix All" command and `editor.codeActionsOnSave`.
- Per-document configuration resolution with strict precedence: a `qlinter.json`
  at the workspace folder root wins, otherwise the `qlinter.presets` and
  `qlinter.rules` settings apply. Loose `.qvs` files with no workspace folder fall
  through to settings.
- `qlinter.presets` and `qlinter.rules` settings contributed to VS Code's native
  settings UI, with the preset picker offering the built-in presets.
  `qlinter.presets` declares `["recommended"]` as its manifest default, so a fresh
  install lints out of the box while the value stays an explicit, user-visible
  setting — VS Code shows it in the Settings UI and it can be set to `[]` to run
  no rules. The extension never writes to the user's `settings.json`.
- Status bar item showing the active configuration source (`qlinter.json`,
  `settings`, or `no rules`); clicking it opens the `qlinter.json` or the settings.
- Resolved configs cached per workspace folder and invalidated on settings
  changes and via a `qlinter.json` file watcher, so a config edit re-lints open
  documents without a reload.
- A broken `qlinter.json` surfaced as an error notification and written to the
  qlinter output channel, rather than being silently ignored; no diagnostics are
  shown for the affected file until it is fixed.
- Fully local processing: the bundled Core engine runs entirely in the editor
  host; scripts never leave the machine. No telemetry is emitted and no network
  request is made; see the [privacy policy](../../docs/PRIVACY.md).
